# DLP - D Language Processing

DLP is a tool collecting commands/tasks related to processing the
D programming language. It uses the DMD frontend as a library to process D code.

## Requirements

To run this tool you need to have druntime and Phobos installed. This is easiest
accomplished by installing the DMD compiler: https://dlang.org/download.html.

## Download

For the latest release see: [releases/latest](https://github.com/jacob-carlborg/dlp/releases/latest).
Pre-compiled binaries are available for macOS, Linux and FreeBSD as 64 bit
binaries and Windows as 32 and 64 bit binaries. The Linux binaries are
completely statically linked and should work on all distros. The macOS binaries
should work on macOS Mavericks (10.9) and later. The FreeBSD binaries are
compiled for FreeBSD 12.

## Commands

### `leaf-functions`

Prints all leaf functions to standard out. A leaf function is a function that
doesn't call any other functions, or doesn't have a body.

#### Usage

```
$ cat test.d
void main()
{
}
$ dlp leaf-functions test.d
test.d:1:6: test.d.main
```

### `infer-attributes`

Prints the inferred attributes of all functions that are normally not inferred
by the compiler. These are regular functions and methods. Templates, nested
functions and lambdas are inferred by the compiler and will not be included by
this command. By default virtual methods are not inferred. Use the flag
`include-virtual-methods` to enable inferring of virtual methods.

#### Usage

```
$ cat test.d
void main()
{
}
$ dlp infer-attributes test.d
test.d:1:6: main: pure nothrow @nogc @safe
```
